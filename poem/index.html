It doesn't seem like much,

but it's been a lot.

I've seen you a million moments,

but it doesn't seem so true.

Ijust wish for one more moment with you.

Amillion goes by so fast,

as lightning does in a storm.

You see it a million times,

but it only seems a few.

To see you're smile a million moments,

didn't know they could go away so fast.

To see you're eyes a million moments,

didn't know you would dream that long.

A million moments isn't as much

as we exaggerate it to be.

We take advantage, so it seems

like nothing.

I've seen you a million moments,

I just wish for one more moment with you.
